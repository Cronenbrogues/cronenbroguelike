# maybe worth adding max_exits and min_exits params?

# how exactly do these probabilities work? if have 10 edges coming out, each with .25 chance of being created...
# do you not want them? or normalize?
# lets say each edge defaults to having a value of "1"
# then when choosing a new edge you sum up and choose
# also want a "no edge" thing? just None?

# so two rounds
# first, generate a set of nodes (Rooms) according to their probabilities and max/min values
# then, link rooms together according to their probabilties and min/max values
# but how to describe the edges?
# defaults:
# actually a bit complicated - want to be able to go "north, south, east, or west" to anything within the same theme
# and if have an edge going "north" somewhere, only want "south" coming back

# ok you're kind of making a graph with probabilistic edges, which then gets turned into a real graph?

# does this gain you much?
# maybe simpler to just allow rooms to add extra edges *on top* of the grid thing?
# like add_special_edge(room, probability, bidirectional)

""" "office" theme ideas
- perfectly normal to start with
- things change when you walk by them multiple times
- after a while they start to increase insanity
- once insanity is high enough then you start seeing exits
- entities
  computer
  fax machine
  Gary
- items
  stapler
what if the entities (especially Gary) became exits themselves?
and then it becomes clear that you were inside some strange creature?

ok, maybe decrease will and increase insanity
think should go to 30 insanity max
that could mean three different "stages" - 0, 15, 30
or 4
4 seems good?
can you just add an exit when you want? think so

Gary could tell increasingly surreal dad jokes
should there be more Garys over time?

what if you added a "laugh" action that's only available in the office
and at first it just makes Gary tell you another joke
eventually Gary becomes some pitiful creature and you have to laugh at it to destroy it

rooms
- your desk
- copy room
- break room
- meeting room
- reception area

computer should become aggressive once insane enough
maybe if attack computer early on things get really weird?

ok, TODOs
- [X] add a few options of each thing! don't get too fancy yet, can flesh out later
- [X] add "your desk"
- [X] add "break room"
- [X] make "computer" actor and spawn it at your desk
- [X] add "use" action for computer
- [X] make "gary" actor
- [X] make gary tell bad jokes
- [X] use coffee machine -> get coffee
- [X] use coffee on gary -> he drinks it
- [X] use coffee on gary -> get ending if at 30 insanity
- [X] on restart, wake up at desk
- [X] make level consistent
- [X] make "use computer" give a bit of insanity
- [X] make copy machine, it can give a bit of insanity if >= 20
- [ ] add the meeting room
- [ ] hook up other strings
- [ ] try a playthrough
...
- [ ] make "enter gary" action
- [ ] make gary drink coffee on his own sometimes
- [ ] make computer kill you if you use at highest insanity

gary's jokes should turn to pleading
as they get darker and darker he should get grosser - "Gary laughs uproariously, spittle flying all over you."
change gary to larry?

what's the ending?
have to get ichor from coffee machine, use it in room with gary to "melt" him into a portal to the next floor?
if you use it on yourself it kills you
and you "jerk awake" at your desk
or maybe you have to use it on the computer?
or if you do something bad happens?

want copy machine?


ok, so first gary gives insanity
then computer
then copy machine (could give a few)?
what's a more surreal interaction? copy machine could do gross stuff
then finally final bit happens in the meeting room? could give you a hint to how to finish
could talk to the heap of bodies

how can you add flavor to make it clear that this is like an occult energy-harvesting operation?
